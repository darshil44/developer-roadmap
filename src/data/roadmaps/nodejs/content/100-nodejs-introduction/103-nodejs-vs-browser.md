The main core difference between the two are:
1. Browser: most of the time what you are doing is interacting with the DOM, or other Web Platform APIs like Cookies.

3. Browser: The browser environment, where you don't get the luxury of choosing what browser your visitors will use, is very convenient.
   Node: Node.js you control the environment. Unless you are building an open-source application that anyone can deploy anywhere, you know which version of Node.js you will run the 
         application on.
